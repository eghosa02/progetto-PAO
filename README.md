# OOP Project

This repository contains the source code and documentation for a university project developed in C++. The project focuses on creating a dashboard application for monitoring sensors and their measurements.

## Overview

The sensor dashboard project aims to provide a user-friendly interface for monitoring various sensors and their measurements. It allows users to view real-time data from different sensors and analyze historical data through visual representations.

## Features

- **Real-time Data Monitoring**: The dashboard displays real-time data from connected sensors.
- **Graphical Representation**: Sensor measurements are presented graphically for better analysis.
- **Sensor Management**: Users can add, remove, and configure sensors within the dashboard.
- **Data Logging**: The application logs sensor measurements for future analysis.

## Technologies Used

- **C++**: The core programming language used for development.
- **GUI Framework**: Qt Creator.
- **Data Visualization**: temperature, movemt and gas.

## Installation

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sensor-dashboard.git

3. Install qmake.

4. run in terminal qmake --project.

5. go to the project file created and add Qt += widgets.

6. run in terminal qmake.

7. run in terminal make.

8. open the .exe file created and enjoy!
